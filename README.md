# Food Logger

A full-stack project aimed to showcase an understanding of object
relational management and the use of Handlebars.js. The website
effectively acts as a to-do list of 'Burgers' a user desires to eat.
Users can manually enter burgers to the list, and then click a button
to mark that burger as eaten.

## Getting Started

To get this application working on your local machine simply clone the
repo and navigate to the enclosed folder. Run 'npm install' to install
all necessary packages. You'll also need to create a SQL database
according to the schema.sql file that is included (a seeds file
has also been included to populate the table). Once that's setup,
simply run the server.js file through node (by typing 'node server.js').

### Prerequisites

You will need node installed on your machine, as well as an SQL
workspace of choice. Also be sure to install the required npm packages.

### Installing



## Deployment

Currently this project is setup to work with Heroku and the Heroku app 
'JawsDB'. You will need to create a SQL database using the credentials
provided by the JawsDB app in your Heroku app's dashboard.
